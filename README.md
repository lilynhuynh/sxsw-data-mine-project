# sxsw data mine project

 Fun project using Selenium to data mine sxsw session information

 The following project uses Selenium to grab panel information based on class, id,
 and tag names. The driver set up code was provided by Colin Vernet.

 Since there is a large database of information, the number of outputted resources can
 be manipulated to support your device/required amount. Furthermore, this is ONLY
 sourcing through the sxsw 2024 SESSIONS, not any other type.

 If you want to access more types, please change the initial URL and some formatting of
 URL accessing will be changed to support the new types.
